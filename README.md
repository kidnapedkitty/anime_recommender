# Anime Recommender

A Jupyter Notebook-based project that explores, builds, and evaluates recommendation systems for anime. This repository demonstrates data exploration, preprocessing, model training (collaborative and/or content-based), evaluation, and simple inference workflows using notebooks.


## Project overview
The aim of this project is to create and evaluate recommender-system approaches for anime (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid models), with an emphasis on reproducible analysis inside Jupyter Notebooks.

Typical goals:
- Explore and clean anime rating data
- Build baseline and advanced recommendation models
- Evaluate using appropriate metrics (precision@k, recall@k, RMSE, MAP, etc.)
- Provide simple inference examples to recommend anime to a user
